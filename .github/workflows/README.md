Our CI/CD script is located in the main.yml file. 

The dictionary.txt file is a file that contains the words that our CD script should ignore when running the grammar check step.
Be careful when adding stuff to it, because we do not want our teaching material to have grammar mistakes.

If you are a student, don't even bother with this folder. Pull requests made to these files will not be accepted.
