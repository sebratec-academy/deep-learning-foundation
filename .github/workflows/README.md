Our CI/CD script is located in the main.yml file. 

The dictionary.txt file is a file that contains the words that our CD script should ignore when running the grammar check step.
Be careful when adding stuff to it, because we do not want our teaching material to have grammar mistakes.

Contributions to the dictionary file may be accepted, since the 
check grammar step into the quality audit may fail to recognize some correct words, such as names, frameworks, programming languages, company names and so on.
