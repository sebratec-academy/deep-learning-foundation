# Deep Learning Foundation

This repository contains the course materials of Deep Learning Foundation course, which is held at Sebratec academy, in Gothenburg, Sweden.

## Course Abstract

In this program, you will develop a strong foundation, both theoretical and practical, of deep learning. With the knowledge acquired here, you will be able to understand what neural networks are, how they learn, and how to use their power to solve real world problems. You will also be able to understand the most cutting-edge research papers on the subject, and will have the opportunity to work in exciting projects and to present your results to industry experts, who will give you valuable feedback.

## Running the materials

Enrolled students have the convenience of an environment that is ready to run these materials. You can find it at https://lab.sebratec.com.

You are also free to run these materials in your computer, if you like. You will need to install python 3, pip3 and the following packages:

- numpy
- sklearn
- matplotlib
- keras
- tensorflow

| Week 1 - 2nd and 4th March 2020             | Welcome, introduction, and basic neural networks | In the first session, you will meet your peers and,teacher, understand what deep learning is, the history of deep learning and how it is changing the world. You will also be introduced to perceptrons, forward and back propagation,,multi-layer perceptrons.In the second session, you will be introduced to the algebra behind perceptrons, forward pass, loss functions and backpropagation, weights, and gradient descent.                             | Lab: The algebra behind a perceptron and training process.                                                                                      |
| Week 2 - 9th and 11th March 2020            | Neural networks learning process                 | In the third session, you will learn about two basic neural network models, regression and classification, how to find good hyperparameters and what is transfer learning. You will also receive orientation about the final project.In the fourth session, you will have a hands on class to put in practice what you have learned in session three. Here you will build these models, play around with hyperparameters, and try different error functions. | Lab: Build a regression and a classification model, and fine tune your hyperparameters.Begin working on the final project.                      |
| Week 3 - 16th and 18th March 2020           | Feeding your neural networks with data           | In the fifth session, you will learn where data come from, how to gather it, how to prepare it to be used by a neural network by preprocessing and balancing it, and how to use your data to train, validate and test your neural network.In the sixth session, you will have a practical class focused in separating, balancing and preprocessing your datasets.                                                                                            | Lab: Dealing with data                                                                                                                          |
